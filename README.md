# Weather App
- This is a Flutter project

# Introduction
- This is my first mobile app project - A Flutter app can view the weather forecast of an area with a specific location. 
- The application consists of 2 pages:
  + Home page to view specific parameters: temperature, humidity, wind speed
  + Detail page to see more measurement parameters at different times in that area
- API:
  + Current weather data: [https://openweathermap.org/current]
  + 5 day weather forecast: [https://openweathermap.org/forecast5]
- UI:
  + Figma: [https://www.figma.com/file/xeSIENCL4qQLPrXt3hQ5Ms/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=XnE5ZLqkgeeyAJ0M-0]
